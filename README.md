## Q&A
Q: Doesn't GNU Go have a color mode?  
A: Yes, however, it's a training tool, and gives the status of groups (alive, dead, critical, etc),  while dango aims to improve board readability and ease of use. GNU Go's extensive documentation can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo_toc.html).
